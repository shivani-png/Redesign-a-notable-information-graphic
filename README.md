# Cholera Outbreak Visualization Redesign Project

## Overview

This project is a modern redesign of the iconic 1854 cholera outbreak map created by Dr. John Snow. By leveraging contemporary data visualization and interactive techniques, this project aims to provide new insights and perspectives into the historical data, illustrating the relationship between cholera cases and water sources. The interactive visualizations bring the story to life, making it easier to understand how data-driven insights can drive public health initiatives.

## Key Features

- **Historical Context**: Revisits the cholera outbreak and maps deaths geographically to uncover patterns.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Redesigns classical data into modern interactive formats.
- **Story Component**: Adds descriptive insights to each visualization to highlight the implications of the findings.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Extracts meaningful conclusions through graphical representation and storytelling.

## Data Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Historical cholera outbreak data, including locations and number of deaths.
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - **Cleaning**: Preprocess data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
   - **Transformation**: Add geospatial coordinates and categorize data for visualization.
3. **Visualization Creation**:
   - Leverage Python libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly) to create compelling graphs and maps.
4. **Output**: Interactive visualizations highlighting spatial relationships and trends.

## Visualizations

### Example 1: Cholera Death Density Map
